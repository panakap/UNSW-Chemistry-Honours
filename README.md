Abstract

The long lifetime of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in exoplanet atmospheres have sparked the interest of astronomers in search of detecting potential technosignatures on exoplanet atmospheres, as they search for signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence. As part of a larger project in detecting over 16,000 known biosignatures, this thesis provides methodology regarding the high throughput computation prediction of infrared spectra between 400-8000 cm-1. An investigation into the harmonic and anharmonic approaches to produce approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation began; determining that Gaussian is the best computational package and vibrational second order perturbation theory the most consistent anharmonic approach under specified input conditions for the routine prediction of accurate approximate infrared spectra. Calculations are performed using density functional theory at the ωB97X-D/def2-TZVP level. Deviation analysis of the harmonics identified the need for scaling factors, which correlated well (R2 = 0.999893) with anharmonic frequencies despite the large root-mean-square deviation (RMSD ≈ 30 cm-1). With considerations of any conformers, the harmonic and anharmonic frequency of the normal modes of vibration are presented, highlighting any overtones and combination bands, and extensively compared to experimental data.
